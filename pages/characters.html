						several years. As a child, Elesis couldn't understand her father's strict
						upbringing. However, as she grew older, she began to understand the importance of her father's methods 
						and dedicated all of her time to improving her strength. Her father, Elscud, joined a team as a member 
						of the unit dedicated to tracking Kaze'aze.

						getting involved in the humans' battle. However, after years of war and finding out that the cause of the battle was 
						Kaze'aze, they decided that they could no longer sit and watch and accepted the Queen of Serdin's request.
