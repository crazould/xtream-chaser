				<h1>
					Story Timeline
				</h1>
				<p>
					The Story Timeline expands the chronological table of Xtreme Chaser history that was 
					provided by KOG and summarizes all known events within the Xtreme Chaser universe. It 
					includes the jobs' backgrounds, passages from missions and stories that were omitted after 
					the story revamp but don't contradict with the established lore, attempting to organize all 
					of them in chronological order. For any inconsistencies found, whether a retcon or mistake 
					from KOG's part, newer information is preferred. If the change originated in Xtreme Chaser 
					Dimensional Chaser, information published during the development of the PC game shall be 
					prioritized as long as nothing drastic was applied in the storyline. While some stories 
					happened in an unspecified time, those that were indicated or hinted to happen between 
					certain events will be placed accordingly. However, events in the manhwa cannot be inserted
					due to having a different narrative from the game.

					Dungeons
				</h1>
				<p>
					The dungeons of Xtreme Chaser are each an adventure unto themselves. Each dungeon has
					four challenge ratings; one to three-star, and Champion Mode, with the exception of Trial
					Forest and Trial Tower, which have no Champion Mode. The one to three-star dungeons change
					the difficulty of the enemies that appear, the number of monsters that appear, and sometimes
					the size of the map. The dungeons are spread across many continents according to their level range. 
					Serdin and Kanavan (formely united into Bermesiah prior Season V) continents are the first two continents, 
					and accompanies players level zero to twenty-seven, Silver Land is suitable for players twenty-four 
					to forty-one, Ellia is suitable for players level thirty-eight to fifty-seven, Xenia is geared towards 
					players level fifty-four to seventy, Alcubra is suitable for players of level seventy-one to seventy-eight, 
					and Archimedia is suitable for players of level seventy-nine and up.

					Missions
				</h1>
				<p>
					Missions also known as Quests are tasks that players perform for rewards, new characters
					or job changes. They generally involve doing various tasks such as defeating a certain amount
					of monsters or collecting a certain amount of a special item dropped by a monster or boss. Most
					missions give experience and GP but there are a few that don't such as Job Change missions. 
					Some missions give out some type of item reward. Whenever a monster has a list icon next to 
					its name, it will always produce that item. If it doesn't, it won't. However, players doing 
					the same type of mission will see the list icon as well such as Job Change missions. In cases 
					such as the 2nd Job mission, the item will appear but it may not drop for some players.
