					<label for="">The Beginning</label>
					<p>
						In the beginning, there was a Creator. The supreme being gave life to Gods who would be responsible
						for creating worlds and Gods in charge of destroying the decrepit ones. These are known as deities and demons respectively.
						Instead of living with the deities in the physical world, the devildom of Elyos was created to house the ferocious demons. 
						When necessary, the demons would traverse through the Dimensional Portals to cause destruction.
						Ernasis the goddess of war and bravery, Lisnar the goddess of mercy and spirit, and Amenias the goddess of wisdom and 
						harmony led to the creation of the world. The world was named after Ernasis, the representative god who had first arrived. 
						It was inhabited by the humans, elves, and dwarves and the goddess selected those with bravery and creativity to help them 
						continue the creation of the world. The gods quickly civilized primitive humans so that they could be spread throughout the
						world and deliver their will. Ernasis gifted them with bravery, Lisnar gifted them with holiness and Amenias gifted them with
						wisdom. With these gifts in hand, the humans bravely expanded their territory, learned to use magic, and used the wisdom to
						develop machinery. Combining their powers, the gods and humans created a civilization at the center of Archimedia and called 
						it Kounat.

					<label for="">Before Kounat, 3300 years prior</label>
					<p>
						Many of the gods fell in love with the humans and the children conceived were born with distinguishable abilities unlike those 
						that were born of just human parents. As the numbers of these children increased, they became known as the Celestials and with the
						gods, they accelerated the development of magic in Kounat. With Kounat at the core, the magic civilization spread to the whole region
						of Archimedia. The dwarves and the elves that inhabited the northern and southern regions of Kounat became influenced by
						the Celestials and through the exchange of information, accepted the advanced civilization. From the exchange, the elves 
						were able to use more powerful magic and the dwarves obtained information to advance their mechanical engineering.
						Out of sight of other goddesses, the Malevolent Horde grew and threatened to destroy everything good in Aernas.
						On a trip to the East, the goddess of life and purity Agnesia found innocents suffering and came face to face with the 
						terrible magical creature made of pure evil. Agnesia used all her powers to seal the creature within her own 
						body and save the world but the consequence of using that forbidden magic drained almost all of her divine powers,
						leading her to the brink of death. Should Agnesia die, the evil in her body would be released.
						On her last legs and spending the last spark of her divine power, Agnesia cast a spell of eternal resurrection.
						Through the ages, Agnesia would be doomed to continue being reborn to keep the seal intact.

					<label for="">First Demon War</label>
					<p>
						he Hardliners faction was not satisfied with the current state of the Demon World and took it upon 
						themselves to destroy the physical world to extend their territories rather than only being expected
						to destroy worlds that were old and decrepit. Heitaros, with his demon troops, had already destroyed
						many other worlds and their next target was Aernas.
						Heitaros opened a Dimension's Door on the eastern part of Kounat in Archimedia and numerous demons 
						made their way into the land. They advanced into the capital of Kounat to first destroy the powerful 
						magic civilization created by the gods. Hearing the news, the three goddesses, the King of Kounat and
						Kounat's troops met the demons at the gates that led into Artione Plains.
						A part of the Moderates, Dio was sent by the Burning Canyon clan as an amnesty to fight alongside 
						Kounat. The Aernas Hammer was the ultimate weapon of Kounat. It was made by converting a 
						device that had accumulated Holy Power into a weapon. It was a weapon that could deal with the 
						damage of the gods without them having to be there.
						The weapon was activated and fired towards the demon troops and Heitaros.

					<label for="">The Year 1448-1454</label>
					<p>
						After two years of exchange training in Serdin, Princess Anyu, Karina, and Princess 
						Enna were on their way back to Kanavan when they ran into Ashtaroth, who had been investigating Bermesiah.
						Though Karina and the princesses survived, Ashtaroth had quickly disposed of the royal 
						families that had traveled with them. Ashtaroth put Karina under a demonization spell 
						which led to her being ruled as the main culprit of the royal family massacre and was exiled from Kanavan.
						The hatred for humans grew in Karina and she decided to follow the traces of evil energy
						that led her to Ashtaroth. Through him, she was reborn as Kaze'aze and learned how to use
						demonic powers and evil magic.
						Ronan Erudon was commissioned as a member of the Royal Guard when he was twelve years old 
						and also appointed as a direct Royal Guard of Princess Anyu who was in the first position of succession for the throne.					
						Princess Anyu ascended the throne as Queen Kanavan and Princess Enna ascended the throne 
						as Queen Serdin.
						With the accession of Queen Kanavan to the throne, Ronan was appointed as the commander of the Royal Guard.
						Kaze'aze had snuck into the Kanavan kingdom and bewitched their Queen, making her do as 
						Kaze'aze willed. Ronan had noticed her existence, however, he too was caught in her enchantment. 
						Using the Queen as her pawn, Kazeâ€™aze prepared for war.

						Long ago after he became a Highlander, Ercnard Sieghart abandoned his name. However, the 
						swordsmen of Kanavan that had watched him fight instinctively thought of the famous Sieghart 
						family and began to call him Sieghart.
						During the war between the deities of Xenia, Lilith who was a Starlet, the highest of Oracles, 
						was kidnapped by the Ascendant God Thanatos and the position has been vacant ever since. 
						In her youth, Sister Maggie had to fill the position herself.
						Since then she has been training and encouraging young sisters in hopes of finding the right 
						girl to fill the position of a Starlet.
						Later in Ellia, Lass had his body stolen by Kaze'aze and plants her soul inside him to use 
						him as a puppet.
						When Rin turned 15, the village of Gaon was wiped out by a massive attack of demonic creatures. 
						All the inhabitants fought bravely, but in the end, Rin was the only one to escape with her life.
						Behind that attack were the Evil Priests, servants of the ancient evil that sought to break free.
						The traumatized Rin was taken by fury. It made her feel the evil growing inside her, trying 
						to break free from the seal. Having come in contact with her dark side for the first time, 
						Rin thought that she needed help to contain the evil within.
						Armed with her sacred fan, Rin decided to ask for help from the people of the great city
